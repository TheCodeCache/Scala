# Akka â€“

**`Akka`** is a powerful toolkit that we can use to build frameworks or applications.  
**It's an implementation of `Actor` Model**  
It makes concurrency easy for programmers by raising the abstraction level.  
It is a concurrency framework built on actors, but it provides all the popular concurrency abstractions available on the market.  
It provides the flexibility we need to build our next enterprise application.  
Akka's STM support lets you safely operate on mutable data structures without leaving the comfort of actor-based concurrency.
